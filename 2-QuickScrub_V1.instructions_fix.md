### **Issue 1: Critical - API Logic Error in Dependency Injection**

*   **Location:** `QuickScrub/api/endpoints.py`
*   **Problem:** The `get_engine()` and `get_registry()` functions are defined to create *new instances* of `ScrubberEngine` and `RecognizerRegistry` on **every single API call**.
    ```python
    # Problematic Code
    def get_engine() -> ScrubberEngine:
        return ScrubberEngine() # Creates a new engine every time

    def get_registry() -> RecognizerRegistry:
        return RecognizerRegistry() # Discovers all plugins every time
    ```
    This is highly inefficient. The `RecognizerRegistry` will re-scan all the plugin files on every request, and we lose the benefit of having singleton instances.
*   **Impact:** Severe performance degradation and unnecessary file I/O on every API call.
*   **Fix:** We should create the instances **once** when the application starts and have the dependency injection functions return the existing instances. This is the correct way to manage singletons in FastAPI.

*   **Corrected Code for `QuickScrub/api/endpoints.py`:**
    ```python
    from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
    from ..models.data_models import ScrubRequest, ScrubResponse, ScrubTask
    from ..core.engine import ScrubberEngine
    from ..core.registry import RecognizerRegistry

    router = APIRouter()

    # --- Singleton Instances ---
    # Create single instances that will be shared across all API requests.
    # This is efficient as they are initialized only once on application startup.
    ENGINE_INSTANCE = ScrubberEngine()
    REGISTRY_INSTANCE = RecognizerRegistry()

    # --- Dependency Injection Functions ---
    def get_engine() -> ScrubberEngine:
        return ENGINE_INSTANCE

    def get_registry() -> RecognizerRegistry:
        return REGISTRY_INSTANCE

    # --- API Endpoint ---
    @router.post("/scrub", response_model=ScrubResponse)
    async def scrub_text(
        request: ScrubRequest,
        engine: ScrubberEngine = Depends(get_engine),
        registry: RecognizerRegistry = Depends(get_registry)
    ):
        """
        Receives text, scrubs it for requested PII types, and returns the result.
        """
        task = ScrubTask(text=request.text, types=request.types, allow_list=request.allow_list or [])
        all_findings = registry.get_findings(task.text, task.types)
        result = engine.scrub(task, all_findings)
        # Use .model_dump() for Pydantic v2 to convert to dict for ScrubResponse
        return ScrubResponse(scrubbed_text=result.scrubbed_text, legend=[LegendItem(**item) for item in result.legend])
    ```
    *   **Self-Correction:** I also noticed the response conversion `ScrubResponse(...)` would fail because `result.legend` is a `List[Dict]` and the model expects a `List[LegendItem]`. The fix `[LegendItem(**item) for item in result.legend]` correctly converts each dictionary into a `LegendItem` model instance.

### **Issue 2: Critical - Incorrect Test Import Path**

*   **Location:** `QuickScrub/tests/test_engine.py`
*   **Problem:** The test file has an incorrect relative import path.
    ```python
    # Problematic Code
    from ..core.engine import ScrubberEngine # This is correct
    from ..recognizers.base import Finding # This is correct
    from ..models.data_models import ScrubTask # This is correct
    ```
    Wait, reviewing again... The paths `..` are correct if you run `pytest` from the project root. The issue is subtler. Running the file directly with `python -m QuickScrub.tests.test_engine` would work, but it's fragile. A more robust setup is to add the project to the Python path. However, for a simple `unittest` setup, the imports are actually correct. The real issue is in `test_recognizers.py`.

*   **Location:** `QuickScrub/tests/test_recognizers.py`
*   **Problem:** There is an inconsistent import style.
    ```python
    # Problematic Code
    from ..recognizers.ip_recognizer import IpRecognizer # Correct relative import
    ```
    Let's re-evaluate. The imports are all fine. The issue I've spotted is in `pyproject.toml`.

*   **Final Finding:** The `dev` dependencies section is incomplete for testing. `pytest` needs a way to understand the project structure.

---

### **Issue 2 (Revised): Critical - Project Configuration for Testing**

*   **Location:** `pyproject.toml`
*   **Problem:** The current setup doesn't explicitly make the `QuickScrub` source code available as an installable package for the testing environment. When you run `pytest`, it might not find the `QuickScrub` module.
*   **Impact:** `pytest` will fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
*   **Fix:** We need to add a `[project.scripts]` entry and configure `pytest` to know where to find the source code by adding a `tool.pytest.ini_options` section. A simpler and more standard fix is to instruct the user to install the package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`), which is what the instructions already say.

**Conclusion for Issue 2:** The code is correct, but the **runtime environment for testing must be set up properly**. The instruction `pip install -e .[dev]` is the correct procedure. The provided code does not need to change.

### **Issue 3: Minor - Missing `__init__.py` Files**

*   **Location:** The `tests` and `api` directories.
*   **Problem:** The `tree` output shows `__init__.py` files in these directories, but they were not included in the generated file list. While modern Python (3.3+) uses implicit namespace packages, explicitly including `__init__.py` is still best practice for clarity and compatibility with older tooling.
*   **Impact:** Low. The code would likely work in most modern environments, but it's less robust.
*   **Fix:** Instruct the AI to create empty `__init__.py` files in `QuickScrub/api/` and `QuickScrub/tests/`.
    *   **Action:** Create file `QuickScrub/api/__init__.py`. Content: (empty).
    *   **Action:** Create file `QuickScrub/tests/__init__.py`. Content: (empty).
    *   **Action:** Create file `QuickScrub/recognizers/__init__.py`. Content: (empty).
    *   **Action:** Create file `QuickScrub/models/__init__.py`. Content: (empty).
    *   **Action:** Create file `QuickScrub/core/__init__.py`. Content: (empty).

The `tree` output in your prompt shows these files already exist, so we just need to ensure they are **not accidentally deleted or incorrect**. The instructions to *overwrite* files are sufficient.
