Overall Assessment
Category	Status	Notes
IP Address (v4)	✅ Success	Perfect detection.
Email	✅ Success	Perfect detection.
Credit Card	✅ Success	Perfect. Correctly finds valid cards and correctly ignores the invalid one.
MAC Address	✅ Success	Perfect detection of all formats.
IP Address (v6)	⚠️ Partial Success	Misses ::1 and still has one false positive.
Sensitive URL	✅ Success	Perfect detection.
Phone Number	❌ Failure	The recognizer is still too strict and misses common US formats.
API Keys / Secrets	⚠️ Partial Success	Vastly improved. Correctly handles JWTs and avoids the low-entropy false positive. However, it missed two prefixed keys.
False Positives	✅ Largely Successful	Correctly ignored most negative test cases.
